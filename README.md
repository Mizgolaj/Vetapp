# Vetapp

**Vet application**
This application has been made to deliver structured data for owners and potential owners of animals.
It consists of three potential modules :
  **1st module** - household animals Contains data for owners and potential owners of household animals. User profile, all data necessary to identify Your pet and connect this data to your chosen veterinary clinic. Also within this module, you will have insight into cafeteria and accommodation places that allow pets inside their building. A veterinary clinic can make its own profile and store data to identify and keep track of changes in registered pets quickly.
  **2nd module** - exotic animals Contains data for owners of exotic animals such as when and where will be the nearest competition which allows designated trained animals. Maintaining animals and providing the best data on all of the necessary equipment to keep them in the best shape. Certification and family structure.
   **3rd module** - farm animals Providing the best structured data to keep the Veterinary clinic informed about the health of monitored animals. Real-time feature with notifications if there will be shown any sign of potential health problems. Scheduling appointments with VeterinaryClinic. Storing and using data for the need of trading farm animals or their products with other registered users.
For the time being implementation consists only for the first module and the database is exemplary.
